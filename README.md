# 🎓 Java Projects – Foundations in Algorithms & Networking

These Java projects were developed during my early university years at the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace**.  
They reflect my first structured exposure to graph algorithms, data structures, and socket-based networking, and were fully implemented using the Eclipse IDE workspace.

## 📊 Graph Algorithms & Visualization

This project focuses on graph theory, algorithm implementation, and visual representation using **Java** and **Graphviz**.

### 🔍 Features:
- Generates a **random undirected weighted graph**
- Implements fundamental algorithms:
  - **BFS** (Breadth-First Search)
  - **DFS** (Depth-First Search)
  - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for shortest paths
  - **Prim’s Algorithm** for minimum spanning tree
- Exports results as **PNG images** using DOT files (Graphviz)

### 🧠 Concepts Learned:
- Java collections and graph data structures
- Graph traversal logic and optimization
- Visual debugging via external tools (Graphviz)
- Exporting images and automated visualization

📁 Main files:
- `main.java`, `create_the_graph.java`, `bfs.java`, `dfs.java`, `prim.java`, `dijkstra.java`
- PNG output of each algorithm

## 💬 Java Socket Group Chat App

A **command-line chat system** built using **Java Sockets**. Users can join a shared chat room after registering or logging in.

### 🌐 Features:
- Supports **multiple concurrent users** via Java threads
- Real-time text exchange using **TCP sockets**
- User authentication using a simple `users.txt` file
- Console features:
  - Welcome messages and timestamps
  - `/exit` command to gracefully disconnect

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced:
- Client-server architecture using `ServerSocket` and `Socket`
- Threading and synchronization for multi-user support
- File I/O and user login management
- Clean shutdown and error handling

📁 Main files:
- `ChatServer.java`, `ChatClient.java`, `UserManager.java`
- `users.txt` – stores username/password credentials
